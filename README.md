# Unity Reinforcement Learning: Cube and Sphere Goal Game with ML-Agents
This project showcases the implementation of a reinforcement learning model using Unity and the ML-Agents library. The game concept involves a cube as the player and a sphere as the goal, with four surrounding walls. The positions of the player and the goal are randomized at each game instance to create a dynamic and unpredictable environment.

To achieve an efficient and successful agent, I had to do extensive parameter tuning and experimentation. After which I made a model that could complete any given game within approximately 25 steps, demonstrating remarkable efficiency. The project involved step-by-step analysis and modifications to various parameters, focusing on input observations and reward systems.

A crucial aspect of the project was the development of an effective reward model. The chosen reward scheme involved calculating the distance between the target and the player. As the distance reduced, the model received rewards, incentivizing it to move closer to the goal. Conversely, if the distance increased, the model received penalties, discouraging undesired behavior. This reward structure played a pivotal role in training the deep learning model to perform as expected.

By combining Unity's game development capabilities with the ML-Agents library, this project showcases the power of reinforcement learning in creating intelligent agents capable of adapting to dynamic environments.

This first ml project piqued my interest in deep learning, I'll continue with making this model more complex or take on a complex project all together. Nevertheless, the learning experience was awesome.
